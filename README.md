Dunno why i made this but it's fun bringing back the feature for beloved SA:MP

(NOTE: No android support if there is empty dialog opened in your client, ask the developer why they didn't use unsigned dialogid lol)

## Installation

Simply install to your project:

```bash
sampctl package install ohmypxl/easyDialog
```

Include in your code and begin using the library:

```pawn
#include <easyDialog>
```

## Usage

I think it's same like awsomedude repo, it's just mine changed stuff.

## Testing

To test, simply run the package:

```bash
sampctl package run
```
